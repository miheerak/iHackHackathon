                <li>Distinguish Gaming from Gambling: To understand gaming better, we also must know that it is not same as gambling. While gaming involves participation in state sanctioned wagering, gambling is when bets are placed on online platforms or locations that are not permitted in the state. Gaming may or may not involve financial transactions but gambling surely does. gaming is the outcome achieved by skill whereas gambling is when it is achieved by chance. We thus recommend all our fellow community members to not indulge into any sort of gambling on our platform, which failing to do so will result into legal repurcusions. </li>
